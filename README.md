# Hidden Div Not Showing After Delay
This repository demonstrates an uncommon HTML bug related to the display property and the use of setTimeout() to show a hidden element.

## Bug Description
The provided HTML code attempts to hide a div initially and show it after a 2-second delay using setTimeout(). However, the div is not explicitly shown initially, and the way setTimeout() is used is incorrect, leading to the element remaining hidden.
